Farm Simulator Protocol White Paper
Introduction
Farm Simulator Protocol (FSP) is a GameFi platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with gameplay involving farm-themed NFTs. Players will own and manage virtual dairy farms, with Dairy Cows, Bulls, and farm environments serving as NFTs. The primary tokens in the game economy are $RAWMILK (an in-game utility token) and $EDAM (the governance and staking reward token).

The game rewards strategic farming, breeding, and staking of $RAWMILK to earn $EDAM tokens. Farm upgrades, breeding mechanics, and a market-driven economy provide a deeply engaging and rewarding gameplay experience.

Core Concepts
NFTs: Dairy Cows, Bulls, and Farm Environments
Genesis Dairy Cows: 10,000 NFTs available at launch, priced at 1 ICP each. Every Dairy Cow has unique genetics, affecting $RAWMILK production rates.
Bulls: 1,000 NFTs priced at 10 ICP each, used for breeding with Dairy Cows to produce new cows. Bulls also have unique traits that influence breeding outcomes.
Farm Environments: Each player receives a randomly assigned Farm Environment NFT upon joining. Farm environments have unique stats, and different cow genetics perform better in certain environments, adding an additional layer of strategy.
Farm Upgrades: Players can enhance their farms by purchasing and applying upgrades, such as new machinery, feed, or enhanced barn features, which improve their farm’s productivity and affect $RAWMILK production.
Game Mechanics
$RAWMILK Production
Daily Yield: Each Dairy Cow produces a certain amount of $RAWMILK daily, influenced by its genetic traits, environment, and farm upgrades.
Production Cap: To maintain scarcity, the total daily production of $RAWMILK across all cows is capped. For example, the total production could be limited to 1 million $RAWMILK per day.
Usage: $RAWMILK is used for breeding, staking, and purchasing farm upgrades. This creates an in-game demand for $RAWMILK, encouraging active participation.
Breeding Mechanics
Breeding between Dairy Cows and Bulls requires a certain amount of $RAWMILK. Bulls can be owned or borrowed from other players, creating an economy for Bull NFTs. The offspring inherit genetic traits from their parents, making breeding a strategic component of the game.
$EDAM Tokenomics
Staking and Rewards
Staking $RAWMILK: Players can stake $RAWMILK to earn $EDAM tokens. The rewards scale with the amount staked and the staking duration, incentivizing long-term engagement.
Initial Supply: $EDAM has an initial supply of 1 million tokens distributed as follows:
70% for staking rewards (700,000 $EDAM)
10% for liquidity pools (100,000 $EDAM)
10% for development and treasury (100,000 $EDAM)
10% for team and advisors, with a vesting schedule (100,000 $EDAM)
Market Dynamics
$EDAM will be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), with the price determined by the open market.
Deflationary Mechanics: To control inflation and maintain $EDAM’s value, the protocol implements burn mechanisms, such as:
Burning $EDAM for major farm upgrades or special events.
A portion of transaction fees on the marketplace being burned.
Economy and Sustainability
Balancing Supply and Demand
$RAWMILK Demand: Players need $RAWMILK for breeding, upgrading farms, and staking, creating continuous demand for the token.
$EDAM Demand: $EDAM is needed for governance, participating in future events, and major farm upgrades. The limited supply ensures scarcity.
Deflationary Pressures: Burning mechanisms for both $RAWMILK and $EDAM keep inflation in check, ensuring a sustainable long-term economy.
Farm Upgrades
Farm upgrades will play a critical role in enhancing productivity and optimizing a player’s farm. Upgrades can include improvements to the milking systems, automated feeders, or barns, and will require $RAWMILK and sometimes $EDAM for major upgrades. These upgrades are essential to maximize $RAWMILK production and increase breeding success rates.

Revenue Model
NFT Sales
The primary revenue source during the initial phase comes from the sale of 10,000 Dairy Cow NFTs and 1,000 Bull NFTs, priced at 1 ICP and 10 ICP, respectively.
Total Revenue from NFT Sales: 10,000 ICP from Dairy Cows and 10,000 ICP from Bulls, leading to an initial influx of 20,000 ICP.
In-Game Transactions
Fees from the in-game marketplace will contribute to the protocol’s treasury.
Breeding costs, farm upgrade purchases, and other in-game actions will generate ongoing revenues.
Governance
$EDAM token holders have governance rights to vote on key protocol decisions, including:

Changes to the $RAWMILK production cap.
Adjustments to staking rewards.
Introduction of new gameplay elements or features. This governance structure ensures that the community has a say in the future development of the protocol.
Conclusion
The Farm Simulator Protocol offers a dynamic and engaging GameFi experience where players can manage their farm ecosystems, earn $RAWMILK, stake to earn $EDAM, and engage in strategic breeding and farm upgrades. The controlled supply, burn mechanisms, and staking incentives ensure that the FSP ecosystem remains sustainable over time, rewarding long-term players and active participants.
