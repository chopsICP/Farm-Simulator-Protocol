Farm Simulator Protocol White Paper
Abstract
The Farm Simulator Protocol is a GameFi project built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that allows users to manage and breed virtual dairy cows and bulls while engaging in a fun and interactive farming experience. The in-game economy revolves around multiple tokens, including $FBUCKS, $RAWMILK, $GOUDA, and $BLUECHEESE. This paper outlines the game's mechanics, tokenomics, and distribution system.

Game Mechanics
Genesis Dairy Cows and Bulls
Genesis Cows: The initial supply consists of 10,000 Genesis Dairy Cows, which are untradeable and free to acquire. All Genesis Dairy Cows are mature upon acquisition and are ready to produce milk and breed.
Bulls: There are 1,000 Bulls available for breeding, priced at 10 ICP each. Bulls also come with their own limited breeding capabilities and are required for breeding cows.
Breeding Mechanics
Free Breeding: Players can breed their Dairy Cows for free using Bulls.
Calf Maturity: Bringing a calf to maturity costs $RAWMILK, with the chance of the cow miscarrying the calf.
Limited Production: Cows have a lifetime amount of milk and calves they can produce before they begin to "wear out," resulting in reduced milk production and increased chances of miscarriage. Bulls also have a limited number of breeding events they can participate in before they "die," determined randomly by genetics.
Token Overview
FarmBucks ($FBUCKS): The main currency of the game with a fixed supply of 1 billion. $FBUCKS can be earned through gameplay, sold for ICP, or traded on decentralized exchanges.
$RAWMILK: Produced by cows daily, with the amount varying day-to-day. $RAWMILK can be sold directly for $ICP or $FBUCKS, or burned to age into $GOUDA.
$GOUDA: Produced by aging $RAWMILK, which can be burned to age into $BLUECHEESE.
$BLUECHEESE: The highest-tier token produced from aging $GOUDA, which can be swapped for $FBUCKS.
Aging Mechanism
Slow Burn System: Players can choose to age $RAWMILK into $GOUDA and $GOUDA into $BLUECHEESE. This encourages a strategic approach to token management and fosters a deflationary mechanic.
Bullfighting
A fun lootbox feature where users can participate in bullfighting events for a chance to win $FBUCKS. Users can enter these events by spending $FBUCKS or purchasing tickets using $ICP.
Farm Environment NFTs
Players can mint farm environment NFTs that have random stats, impacting cow performance. The supply is unlimited, and the minting cost is 1 ICP.
Tokenomics
$FBUCKS: Total Supply - 1 billion
Allocated for $RAWMILK, $GOUDA, and $BLUECHEESE swaps.
$RAWMILK: Unlimited supply, produced daily with random variability. Can be exchanged for $ICP or $FBUCKS or burned to produce $GOUDA.
$GOUDA: Produced from aging $RAWMILK, limited by the supply of $RAWMILK available for aging.
$BLUECHEESE: Produced from aging $GOUDA, limited by the supply of $GOUDA available for aging.
Genesis Distribution
Lucky Wheel
Players can spin the lucky wheel once per day for free or spend a cost in $FBUCKS to spin again.

First 1,000 Cows and Bulls: 80% chance of winning.
Next 1,000 Cows and Bulls: 60% chance.
Next 2,000 Cows and Bulls: 40% chance.
Next 3,000 Cows and Bulls: 20% chance.
Next 3,000 Cows and Bulls: 10% chance.
Next 2,000 Cows and Bulls: 5% chance.
Last 2,000 Cows and Bulls: 2% chance.
Last 1,000 Cows and Bulls: 1% chance.
Final 1,000 Cows and Bulls: 0.01% chance.
Distribution Graph


Conclusion
The Farm Simulator Protocol is designed to provide players with an engaging and interactive farming experience while integrating an innovative token economy. Through the combination of breeding mechanics, aging tokens, and a fun gameplay environment, players will have the opportunity to create their own virtual farms and participate in a unique GameFi ecosystem.

Farm Upgrades
Upgrade System: Players can improve their farms through Farm Upgrades, enhancing efficiency and productivity. Upgrades range from better barns and grazing pastures to technological advancements like automated feeding systems.
Upgrade Benefits: These upgrades can boost $RAWMILK production, improve the health of the cows, or increase the genetic diversity of the herd. Rarer upgrades provide stronger benefits, helping players optimize their farm setup.
